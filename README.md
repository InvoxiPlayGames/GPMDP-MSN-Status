## Q&A
- Q: Isn't MSN Messenger/Windows Live Messenger dead?
A: The official servers are, but there is an unofficial server called [Escargot](https://escargot.log1p.xyz).
- Q: Why is the code so messy?
A: I'm not that good at prettifying code.

A: XP and Vista aren't supported by GPMDP, and XP isn't supported by .NET 4.5.2.
